# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Mad Libs Story Game"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a game like Mad Libs where the user blindly fills in nouns, verbs, and adjectives to be added to a story.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will present the user with a table of contents where they can choose one of four stories to play. The user will be asked to blindly input a list of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. When they are finished, a completed story will print using the words that they entered. In addition to the printed story, a hand drawn image will open. After the user is finished with the story they chose, they will be given the option to choose another story, or end the game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I will be working alone on this project.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome will be having a working game with at least two story options.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome will be having a completed game with all four story options.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will be having a complete game with all four story options and functionally opening the correlating image with each printed story.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

One new skill I will need to acquire is importing and opening image files with Python. I plan to research online how to do this downloading and using Python Imaging Library on my computer.
